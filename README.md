# Fatty_Liver_Disease
Fatty Liver Disease (FLD) is a global health challenge needing early detection and prediction. Our project uses machine learning algorithms to predict NAFLD, focusing on clinical features from Liver Function Tests. The dataset includes age, gender, and liver function parameters. We employ hybrid models to enhance NAFLD prediction accuracy.
