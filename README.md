# Fatty-Liver-Disease-Prediction
Here i tried to implemet fatty liver disease prediction using some machine learning models Like SVM LR RF etc.But for the uploaded project i selected LR model You can replace the model with the model of your choice if needed Check out the readme before executing

# Steps for Execution 
* Fork the repo
* Setup project on your local machine
* If you want to explore pre processing code
* Navigate to models -> PRE PROCESSING
* Open the code and replace the necessary path of the dataset
* NOTE After pre processing I added a column to the dataset that is AST/ALT to calculate this just divide (Sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase / Â Sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase) which are already present in the dataset
* Ans also replace result column with the class column with appropriate values for more information compare main dataset with my pre-processed train dataset
* If you wish to ignore the pre processing task i have already provided the pre-processed train and testing csv file
* Just open the LR model which is present inside models
* Replace path witht training data and testing data
* Run the model to generate the model.pkl file sample file is also provided in the code
* Now run the main.html file to open up the interface
* Go to the project folder and start the command propmpt and type "python app.py" to run the backend
* Now go to the web page fill the required details and submit
* Now a Live disease predictor form will appear now open the testing data and select a record
* Enter all the values and click on predict
